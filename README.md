A small program to render PMS files, Map files for the game [Soldat](http://soldat.thd.vg/en/), hopefully to become part of a map editor in the future.

You will need [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org) to compile and run, as well as [this java PMS parser](http://forums.soldat.pl/index.php?topic=29080.0) which is used to load the map (these jar files are in the lib folder now)

Thanks to Matthias Mann for various file decoders, and mattdesl (github) for his Texture class
